# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This collaborative project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains historical records of passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic information and survival outcomes.

Our goal was to build, evaluate, and interpret predictive models to understand factors influencing survival and achieve accurate predictions.

## Objectives
- Merge and clean data from multiple sources.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and feature selection.
- Develop multiple predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes).
- Evaluate and compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Select the best-performing model based on thorough analysis and clear rationale.

## Methodology

We explored various machine learning techniques, tuning hyperparameters through cross-validation. The final model selected was based on its predictive performance and interpretability.

## Key Findings

- Identified important features influencing survival such as passenger class, age, and sex.
- Achieved optimal performance with a Random Forest model, which provided the best balance between accuracy and interpretability.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix:
- Accuracy:
- Precision:
- Recall:
- F1-score:
